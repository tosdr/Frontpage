In the summer of 2012, <a href=\"http:\/\/hugoroy.eu\/index.en.html\">Hugo Roy<\/a> (<a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/hugoroyd\">@hugoroyd<\/a>) started the legal analysis and brought the project to life. Since then, more people have joined the team and have contributed through the reviewer community. Ultimately, all the work is transparent and the discussions happen in public. Our work is <a href=\"thanks\">funded<\/a> by non-profits organisations and individual donations and gets released as <a href=\"http:\/\/fsfe.org\/about\/basics\/freesoftware.html\">free software<\/a> and open data.",
